#Welcome!

For this first meeting we will use 
  https://tryhaskell.org/
to explore simple expressions in the programming language Haskell.

We will start with the tutorial.

#Values and types

First a few words about values and types.
...

#Name and reuse

To compute more complex expressions it is possible (and recommended) to name and reuse expressions.
...

#Functions



#The Haskell calculator: ghci

We have used tryhaskell.org for now, but as homework for next time please install haskell-platform which gives you access to Haskell also off-line.
