So you're going to install Haskell on Windows! Great!
----------------------------
Start with visiting the page:

Go to the Windows icon.
Click one of the links either the 32bit or 64bit. The safest version is to take the 32bit.
This download will take around 10 minutes depending on your internet connection.
