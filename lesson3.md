#Lesson 3

In [lesson 1](lesson1.md) we used https://tryhaskell.org/ to go
through the basics of Haskell without installing anyhting. In
[lesson 2](lesson2.md) we talked more about programs, compilers and
computers and made sure to
[install Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/platform/) to enable off-line
use and more convenient [editing](editor.md).

In this lesson we will focus on functions, types and lists.

#Simple functions and their types

In [Lesson3/Functions.hs] there is a sequence of functions definitions
used to introduce the syntax step by step.

#Make your own types

[Lesson3/Datatypes.hs] explores how you can define your own types and
functions using them.

#Lists and recursion

#If you wonder anything about Haskell
Haskel has it's own search engine!
