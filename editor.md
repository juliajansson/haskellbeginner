# Installing and using a text editor for Haskell programming

An editor is not the same thing as a *word processor* (like
Microsoft Word) because the editor is specialized at handling "raw
text" while the word processor is aimed at "formatted text".

## Emacs

Emacs is a very flexible editor (used by Patrik and many others).

(Here is an advanced tutorial for how to set up the editor emacs.

)

## Notepad++

For Windows it might be easier to install the editor Notepad++ instead of emacs.
